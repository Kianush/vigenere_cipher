1. We appreciate quality of decrypting algorithm with
   minimal text lenth that we can decrypt.

   It is command option of application '--test_algorythm'
   use ./vigenere_cipher --test_algorythm [input file]

   Input file is not decrypted english text, use 
   texts with 1000..10000 symbols to increase test time.

   The input file into the application will be encrypted with known key,
   after that decrypt with frequencies analiz algorythm,
   if the guess key and internal known key are equaled,
   we increase input text array, and repeat itteration.

   When guess key and known key are not equal, we will stop
   the size of input text array, at previous itteration is 
   minimal length of text that we can decrypt. It will be
   show at output: 'result_test_minimal_lenght is: 383'

2. Tests are in bash scrypt 'test_vigenere_cipher',
   there are 32 test cases, thats shows work of application 
   in normals and errors routines. 
   They are:
	2.1 call application without arguments
	2.2 call application with unknow arguments
	2.3 call application with help command --help
	
	2.4 call application with encrypt command without  
	    input and output files specifyed
	2.5 call application with encrypt command with only input file
	2.6 call application with encrypt command with non exist input
	    file
	2.7 call application with encrypt command with source file
	    without read rights 
	2.8 call application with encrypt command with dest file
	    without write rights
	2.9 call application with encrypt command with empty
	    source file
	2.10 call application with encrypt command with right specyfied files
	
	2.11 call application with decrypt command without  
	    input and output files specifyed
	2.12 call application with decrypt command with only input file
	2.13 call application with decrypt command with non exist input
	    file
	2.14 call application with decrypt command with source file
	    without read rights 
	2.15 call application with decrypt command with dest file
	    without write rights
	2.16 call application with decrypt command with empty
	    source file
	2.17 call application with decrypt command with right specyfied files

	2.18 call application with analiz command without input file
	2.19 call application with analiz command with non exist file
	2.20 call application with analiz command with no read rights
	     input file
	2.21 call application with analiz command with empty file
	2.22 call application with analiz command with file that
		contain one symbol
	2.23 call application with analiz command with no sense file
	2.24 call application with analiz command with right specifyed
		encrypted file

	2.25 call application with test algorithm command without input
		file 
	2.26 call application with test algorithm command with non exist
		file
	2.27 call application with test algorithm command with no read rights
	     input file

	2.28 - 2.32 calls application with test algorithm command with
		diffenent kinds of text files
