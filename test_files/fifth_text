Members of the Early English Text Society receive each year the editions published by the Society in the Ordinary Series for that year. Usually, there are two publications each year, though not always so. Individual members of the Society, but not institutions, who would prefer not to receive the new publications may instead substitute any past volumes from the Society's list which are currently in print up to the value of Â£60.00 or $120, depending which currency one has paid the subscription in. (Each new year's subscription accrues a new credit against the back-list.) Members also receive a copy of the Society's brief annual report and the Society's accounts. Very occasionally, extra books are published in the Supplementary Series; those volumes are not sent to members in return for their annual subscription but they are available to members at a reduced pre-publication price; a notice about each volume is sent to members in advance of publication.
