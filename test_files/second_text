The Original Series began in 1864 and continues to the present. In 1867 an Extra Series was started, of texts already printed but not in satisfactory or readily obtainable editions. In 1921 the Extra Series was discontinued and all publications were subsequently listed and numbered as part of the Original Series. In 1970 the Supplementary Series was initiated: volumes in this series are issued only occasionally and as suitable texts become available.

New volumes are published on behalf of the Society by the Oxford University Press, which also holds the backlist dating back to 1864. During April 2016 we are engaged in moving our physical stock and over the summer of 2016 we are starting to convert some out-of-print titles to print-on-demand. We apologize for any delays in production and delivery over this period, while we set up new systems for the longer term.
