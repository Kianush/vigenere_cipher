Algorithm description
1. We allocate two dimension array 'symbols_frequence_into_crypted_text' 
   with dimensions MAX_KEY_LENGHT+1 x ALPABET_POWER,
   where MAX_KEY_LENGHT - maximum key lenght, 12 in this version, 
	 ALPHABET_POWER - quantity letters in english aplhabet.
   We also have typical frequencies of letter in english texts
   placed in array 'symbols_frequence_part_of_one'.

2. We get by symbols encrypted text from file, count the symbols of letters,
   and increment cells of two dimension array, related to decimation step
   and getted symbols. So in the first column of two dimension array
   we have count of each first symbol, in the second count of each second, etc.

3. We normalize the two dimension array, after that we have frequencies of letters (in rows)
   in the encrypted text with different steps of decimation (in columns)

4. We will find correlation sequence between symbols_frequence_into_crypted_text[column]
   each column contained frequencies letters array 
   and symbols_frequence_part_of_one, that contained typical frequencies letters in
   english texts, ordered by index ('a'-0 ... 'z'-25)

5. We find ratio 'maximum : middle_level' in each of correlated sequensies         

6. We have array of ratios, we will find index of maximum in this array, it
   is guess lenght of vigenere key

7. We return to the correlated sequence, pointed (marked) as maximum from 6 step

8. In the correlation sequence we will find maximum element, index of it show the
   first letter of vigenere key, in order in english alphabet

9. We allocate two dimension array with dimensions guess_key_lenght x ALPABET_POWER

10. We will find frequencies of symbols ordered by number of rests to guess key lenght 
    [number_of_symbol % guess_key_lenght].

11. We find correlation between each column that contained frequencies,
    the number of the column relatad to number of letters in guess key

12. We find indexes of maximums in the correlated sequencies,
    the indexes is numbers of letters key in english alphabet.

13. We have guess key and can decrypt the vigenere encrypted text
